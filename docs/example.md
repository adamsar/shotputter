## Demo

This page hosts a basic demo that DOES NOT integrate with 
external services, but does demonstrate the screen shot annotation feature and 
the type of data that it's possible to pass on to developers.

<script src="http://localhost:9000/shotputter.js"></script>
<script>
const instance = window.Shotput({
                service: false,
                captureLogs: true
***REMOVED***
</script>
